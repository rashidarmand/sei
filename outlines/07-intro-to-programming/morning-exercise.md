# Morning Exercise

1. Create 4 variables named `eleven`, `twentyTwo`, `thirtyThree`, `fortyFour`. Set them equal to `11`, `22`, `33`, and `44` respectively.

2. Store the values of the variables in an array named `doubles` from largest to smallest.

3. Loop thru `doubles` and display each number in the console from smallest to largest.

4. Loop thru `doubles` again. This time if the number is even then log the statement `"The number [number] is even!"`. If the number is odd then display `"The number [number] is odd!"`

_Note: **[number]** indicates the value of the element you are looping thru._
