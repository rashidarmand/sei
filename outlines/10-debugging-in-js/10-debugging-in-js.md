# Debugging and Clean Code

_"It's time to take out the garbage!" (intended to be read like a 90s action hero)_

## Debugging definition

_Debugging is the process of finding errors in your code and then rectifying them_

## How to debug

1. If you are the code author
    - Double check that you have attempted to use [problem solving techniques](../09-problem-solving-algorithms-js/09-problem-solving-algorithms-js.md) to create your solution
    - If not move to step 2
2. Identify the type of error it is
3. Strategize on a solution
4. Execute your strategy

## Types of errors

The most common errors you will see when programming are:

- Syntax errors
- Runtime errors
- Logic errors (bugs)
- Race condition (well sort of..)

## Syntax error

_The error you recieve when your code is not able to be understood by the programming language_

```js
function welcome ToClass() {
  // other code here
} // SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected (
```

## Runtime error

_An error that occurs during execution phase of a program_

```js
function subtract(num1, num2) {
  return num1 - num2
} // ReferenceError: subtact is not defined

subtact(10, 9)
```

## Logic error

_An error that occurs not because your code is written incorrectly, but because it doesn't do what you want it to_

```js
let array = ["stuff", "to", "put", "in", "a", "list"]

// I am looping thru the array starting at 1 instead of 0
for(let i = 1; i < array.length ;++i){
  console.log(array[i])
} // to, put, in, a, list

// whoops D-:
```

## Exceptions

_Exceptions are unexpected behavior that can not be accounted for under normal circumstances_

[MDN: Try...Catch...Finally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

## Race condition

_A race condition is what happens when two competing parts of a program are running simultaneously and data relevant to one part is not available because the other part has not finished executing_

<img src="wat.jpg" width="1000px">

### Scenario

_You have an html document and a js file linked together. You want to target a paragraph tag on the page so you write the code to do so but you notice something. However, your javascript keeps hitting a runtime error stating that the html element does not exist. It happens sometimes, but not other times. You have checked your code several times over and you are certain the code looks correct._

__This is more than likely a race condition between the html and the javascript code__

### What exactly is happening here?

The html has not finished drawing the html element in question and the javascript is looking for an element that does not exist yet.

### What is the solution?

There are various approaches:
- Put your javascript at the end of the html document

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- putting it here may cause the race condition -->
  <head>
  <body>
    <!-- your html element code goes here -->
    <script type="text/javscript" src="main.js"></script>
  <body>
</html>
```

- Add the attribute `defer` to your script tag so that your code only executes once the entire html document is loaded

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!--
      the defer attribute defers the loading of this script
        until the entire document is loaded
     -->
    <script type="text/javscript" src="main.js" defer></script>
  <head>
  <body>
  <body>
</html>
```

- Wrap all your javascript code in a function that fires when the document is loaded

```js
// this callback executes only when the entire page has finished loading
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  // rest of code goes here
});
```

## Tools

### Stack Trace

_A stack trace is a list dictating what functions have been executed that is provided to you when an error occurs in your js code_

### Console

_The console is where you can experiment with language commands line by line. This is useful if you need to experiment with code._

The console can be accessed in one of two ways:
- Inspect the page as normal -> navigate to console tab on browser
- Type `node` on the terminal with no filename

[Chrome: Devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

### Error Messages

### Example

```js
function sayHello() {
   return "hello"
}

function sayHelloAgain() {
  let output = ""
  
  for(let i = 0; i < 2 ;++i) {
    // this is mispelled
    output += sayHelo()
  }
  
  return output
}

sayHelloAgain()
/*
  ReferenceError: sayHelo is not defined
    at sayHelloAgain:9:5
    at eval:15:1
    at eval
    at new Promise
*/
```

## Techniques

- Understand the error
- Remove or comment code to find error code
- Clean up code to make it easier to debug

### Exercise

_What is wrong in this code snippet?_
```js
function magicDoor(doorNumber) {
  let prefix = "You have won";let output = "";
  if(doorNumber === "1") {
    output = `${prefix} a brand new car!`
  }
  
  if(doorNumber == 10) {output = `${prefix} a brand new tent!`
  }if(doorNumber == -2) {
    output = `${prefix} a brand new house!`
  }
  
  if(doorNumber == 1) {
    output = `${prefixz} a brand new rock!`
  
    
  }
  
  if(doorNumber > -1) {
output = `${prefix} a brand new phone!`
  }
  return output
}

magicDoor(1)
/*
  ReferenceError: prefixz is not defined
    at magicDoor:13:17
    at eval:24:1
    at eval
    at new Promise
*/
```

## How to Google

1. [Understand the Problem](../09-problem-solving-algorithms-js/09-problem-solving-algorithms-js.md)
2. Search for the keywords associated with your problem
3. Identify if this article / code snippet is applicable
    - If not then go back to step 2
4. Understand the solution
5. Execute the solution
    - If it is a code snippet, type it out in your own style

## Stackoverflow

- Understand the strategy behind the solution
- Ask yourself: What can you learn from their code?
- __Copying and pasting will hinder your learning__

__Note: Do not abuse this tool to just find answers, this will not help you learn__

### How can I make it sexy?
- Understand standards
- Let your code breathe
- Name your variables appropriately
- Maintain consistency
- Prefer readability
- Clean up throughout the process
- Follow a guide

__Note: When working collaboratively, establish coding style early__

### Understand Standards

_Read through the best practices and standards set forth by the community._

Clean JS
```js
// this reads very well
function multiplyName(name, numberOfTimes) {
  let output = ""

  for(let i = 0; i < numberOfTimes; ++i) {
    output += name
  }

  return output
}

multiplyName("orlando", 3) // orlandoorlandoorlando
```

Ruby style is a little different
```ruby
# this reads very well
def multiply_name(name, number)
  output = ""

  number.times do
    output += name
  end

  return output
end

multiply_name("orlando", 3) # orlandoorlandoorlando
```

This is considered better
```ruby
# this is much more concise and readable
def multiply_name(name, number_of_times)
  name * number_of_times
end

multiply_name "orlando", 3
```

### Let your code breathe

```js
function loopThruArrayAndDoStuff(array) {
  let randomVariable=10
  let otherRandomVariable=1000
  let lastVariable=-45
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {lastVariable+=otherRandomVariable}
  return lastVariable
}

loopThruArrayAndDoStuff([10, 9, 40, "hello", "goodbye"])
```

### Naming

_"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things" - Phil Karlton_

Tips:
- Name your variables based on what it's values represent
- Name functions based on behavior
- Don't be afraid to use longer names

```js
// why?
function f(x) {
  let s = 0
  
  for(let i = 0; i < x.length ; ++i) {
    s += x[i]
  }

  return s
}

f([10,5,2]) // 17
```

### Maintain consistency

I prefer you pick a style and stick to it than for you to mix and match styles

```js
// both are fine, just pick one and stick to it
function oneWay(argument1, argument2){
  // code
}

function anotherWay ( argument1 , argument2 )
{
  // code
}
```

### Prefer readability over flexing

```js
// this is difficult to read
function maxFlex(gender, name) {
  
  // ok we get it bruh
  return `${gender == "male" ? "His" : "Her"} majesty ${name}!`
}

// this is more readable
function mediumFlex(gender, name) {
  let prefix = gender == "male" ? "His" : "Her"

  return `${prefix} majesty ${name}!`
}

// this is even more readable
function noFlexZone(gender, name) {
  let prefix = ""

  if(gender == "male") {
    prefix += "His"
  } else {
    prefix += "Her"
  }

  return `${prefix} majesty ${name}!`
}
```

### Clean up throughout the process

_Very much like cleaning your house / apt_

- Leaving it for last will frustrate you
- You can prevent bugs because your code is neat and organized
- When you are stuck, cleaning up will activate your creative brain
- You build momentum because you are always making progress (shaving ice)
- This will add to your muscle memory

### Follow a guide

## Workshop

["We Need Bug Spray!"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xCfp0ybglr7qwdg-nQT4RFyTICYmTazjulISm7BqkV8)

## Extra Challenges

### Challenge 1

Given an arbitrary integer as a celsius temperature, create an algorithm to convert it to a fahrenheit temperature.

### Challenge 2

Given an array of unsorted numbers, create an algorithm to sort them in descending order.

```js
[1, 0, 21, 2, 506, 9, 67]
```

### Challenge 3

Given an the following array of unsorted numbers create an algorithm to find an arbitrary element in the array.

```js
[1, 0, 21, 2, 506, 9, 67] 
```

### Challenge 4

You and your friends are getting dinner at your favorite restaurant.
Create a function named tipAmount that when given a total bill value, number of people, and a tip percentage; uses this information to calculate the tip amount and return this value in a string that says "${Tip Amount} per person"

```js
tipAmount(50, 5, 10) // "$1 per person".
```

### Challenge 5

You're tasked with creating a string parser that will tell you how many times a letter appears in a string. 
Create a function called parser that given a letter ( Ex. "a" ) and a string ("Ex : daslndeungnsio393c810sx") can return how many times that letter appears.

```js
parser("a", "aaaa3fvsdfr") // 4
```
