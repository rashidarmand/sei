# Morning Exercise

Take a look at the [`index.html`](index.html) and [`students.js`](students.js) files located in this folder. Modify the `students.js` file to loop thru each student in the `students` array and `append` each student as a new `li` within the `ul` element on the html page.

Within each `li` you should have the student:
- `name` within a `<strong>` tag
- `gender` within a `<em>` tag
- `famousPhrase` within a `<p>` tag

**Note:** Try adding more students to the array.
