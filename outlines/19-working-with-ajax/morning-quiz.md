# Morning Quiz

#### Answer the following questions on a piece of paper or in a digital file (`.txt` or `.md`) until we review.

1. What is the difference between `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`?
2. If I were to describe a computer in code with behavior specific to it would I create a `class` or a `function`? Why?
3. Let's say I have two files:
    - `index.html`
    - `index.js`.

    I have one line of code in the `index.js` file:
    ```js
    document.querySelector("ol")
    ```
    
    When I run it, the console notifies me of an error that it cannot find the `ol` in the page. I look at my `index.html` and it is actually there. What is the likely situation that is happening? What would I do to solve the problem?
4. Why would you use a visual framework such as Bootstrap or Materialize over coding a frontend from scratch?
5. You are working on a project that is due tomorrow. You have many features left to complete before the deadline but you don't have enough time to complete them all. How would you proceed from this point?
