# Morning Exercise

Please review the information on the [axios github page](https://github.com/axios/axios) as well as the original [ajax lecture](../19-working-with-ajax/19-working-with-ajax.md).

1. Create a plain html page. On this page their should only be a `<head>` tag where you link your js code and a `<body>` tag that is empty.
2. Use the `axios` library to get all students from the sei api where the endpoint url is `https://sei-api.herokuapp.com/students`. Loop thru all students returned and create a `ul` element that houses each student within an `li` element. Display only their capitalized `name` within a `<strong>` tag and what the person is `known-for` within an `<em>` tag.

**Challenge:**

Display each student in alphabetical order.
