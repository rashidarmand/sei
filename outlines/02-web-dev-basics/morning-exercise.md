# Morning Exercise

Create a two page html website dedicated to people who love pens.

## Requirements:

- The first page should have:
  - some header text
  - a picture of the "pen of the day"
  - some text briefly describing what the site does
  - a dropdown menu with 3 different types of pens available to choose from
  - a navigation menu linking to the home page and the second page
- The second page should have:
  - some header text
  - A gallery of 6 pens
  - a navigation menu linking to the home page and this second page
- No css is necessary

_Note: If you are having trouble coming up with descriptive text or header text, just fill it with some dummy text and come back to that portion when you are done. You can use a text generator such as [Lorem Ipsum](https://lipsum.com/)_

## Challenge

Try adding a third page. This third page should have:
  - some header text
  - a contact form that allows you to submit a the person's email address as well as some paragraph text
  - a navigation menu linking to the home page, the second page, and the this third page

What other minor detail would you need to change on the other two pages in order to make this website complete?
