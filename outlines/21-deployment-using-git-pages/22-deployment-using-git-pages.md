# Github Pages

_Github pages is way to host your static websites (no servers / databases) by using a github repository_

## Setup

- Create a repository on Github
- Clone the repository onto your local computer
- Add a branch called `gh-pages`
- Push your code to the `gh-pages` branch on Github
- Go to the settings page of your repository on Github
- Scroll down to the section named "Github Pages"
- In the "Scroll" sub menu click on the dropdown that says "None" and choose the option that says "gh-pages" branch (if its not already set)

**Note: Alternatively, you can setup your repository to use your master branch as the source for the website. However, using the `gh-pages` branch keeps what you want to see on your website separate from what you have as your master copy of your code.**
